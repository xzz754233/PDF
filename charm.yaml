    # SaaS Launchpad
    
    Turn a rough text idea into a technical blueprint and code skeleton in minutes. This agent simulates a mini engineering team to validate your concepts.
    
    ## How to Use
    Simply describe your software idea in the **Project Idea** field. Be as specific as possible.
    
    **Good Input Examples:**
    * "A Python script that scrapes Shopee prices daily and notifies me on Line."
    * "An AI agent that reads PDF resumes and extracts candidate skills."
    * "A Telegram bot that tracks Ethereum gas fees."

    ## What You Will Get
    The crew will generate 4 essential files for your MVP:
    
    1. **Spec Analysis (`1_spec.md`)**: 
       Core feature breakdown, risk assessment, and competitor analysis.
    2. **Tech Stack (`2_tech_stack.md`)**: 
       Recommended Python libraries (with `pip install` commands) and API providers.
    3. **Skeleton Code (`3_mvp_skeleton.py`)**: 
       A logically structured `main.py` with classes, functions, and comments ready for development.
    4. **Final Report (`final_report.pdf`)**: 
       A consolidated, professional PDF document containing all the above insights.
